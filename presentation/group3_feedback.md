# Group 3 Presentation Feedback

Case Report Generation System

- Good oral introduction for what the system is, but the visuals did not help.
- The explanation of the problem to solve,
    retrieving patients' reports, is very clear.
- Moving the calculations in the reports into SQL is very interesting,
    and makes the system more suitable to this course.
- The intended users, patients, doctors, and researchers, can be emphasized,
    and their interactions with the database can be specified.
